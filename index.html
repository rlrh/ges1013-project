        Instructions
      </p>
      <p>
        This game is divided into 3 parts. Using information and clues given in
        this website (chat bot), you will be guided to explore 6 different
        locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1st half of the game, you will visit 3 sites
        <strong>virtually</strong>. This means that you can play the game at any
        time and place. You will also need access to the internet to help you
        complete the tasks in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 2nd half of the game,you will need to visit the other 3 sites
        <strong>in person</strong>. Information will still be provided in the
        chatbot to guide you. In addition to using the internet, you need to
        physically explore the sites to search for clues and to complete tasks.
        The <strong>travelling time between each site</strong> is around 15 to
        25 mins by bus or 5 to 10 mins by car.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not have to complete the game at one go as your progress will be
        <strong>auto-saved</strong> after you complete each location. This will
        be indicated by this message: “Your progress has been saved.” Do note
        that you will have to use the same device.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Good luck and we hope that you enjoy the game!
